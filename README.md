An easy game using basic poo concepts and tkinter in Python. The game concept is simple: you create a character with a name and a class (either wizard or warrior), and then you fight against a single enemy. 
In the character's code, there's an unused class called 'Super-Monster.' If you want to add it to the game at some point, you can.

To run this project, make sure you have tkinter installed on your PC
To install tkinter
